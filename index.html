                <p id="main-paragraph">This page is an overview of the React documentation and related resources.</p>
                <p class="second-pargraph"> <b>React</b> is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
                    Learn what React is all about on our homepage or in the tutorial.</p>

                <h1 id="second-heading">Try React</h1>
                <p class="second-pargraph"> React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption,
                    and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React,
                    add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app,
                    the links in this section will help you get started.
                </p>

                <h1 id="third-heading">Online Playgrounds</h1>
                <p class="second-pargraph"> If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML
                    file, edit it,
                    and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation,
                    so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos.
                </p>

                <h1 id="forth-heading">Learn React</h1>
                <p class="second-pargraph"> People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning
                    styles.
                    Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section
                    helpful..</p>

                    as
                    little or as much React as you need. Perhaps you only want to add some “sprinkles of interactivity”
                    to
                    an existing page. React components are a great way to do that.</p>

                <p class="second-pargraph">In this section, we will show how to add a React component to an existing
                    HTML page.
                    You can follow along with your own website, or create an empty HTML file to practice.
                    There will be no complicated tools or install requirements — to complete this section,
                    you only need an internet connection, and a minute of your time.

                <h1 id="third-heading">Add a DOM Container to the HTML</h1>
                <p class="second-pargraph"> First, open the HTML page you want to edit.
                    Add an empty <code>&ltdiv&gt</code> tag to mark the spot where you want to display something with
                    React.

                <h1 id="forth-heading">Create a React Component</h1>

                    and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.
                    It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features,
                    provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production.</p>

                    comfortable using JavaScript tools yet, consider adding React as a plain
                    <code>&ltscript&gt</code> tag on an HTML page, optionally with JSX.
                    This is also the easiest way to integrate React into an existing website.
                    You can always add a larger toolchain if you find it helpful!

                    small packages to optimize load time.
                    A compiler such as Babel. It lets you write modern JavaScript code that still works in older
